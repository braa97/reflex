To do:
    Make code cleaner.
    Divide code into more functions.
    Create a data handler file so you can store all the functions in it.
    Add more movies, I can't stress this enough, ADD MORE MOVIES.
    When in movie description, when clicking on catalog, it routes us to the catalog page but with no user. FIX IT.
    You can make call back functions on the "onClick" methods by writing it like this: onClick={() => {function(parameter)}}.
    Save the data from renting and lending movies in local storage.
