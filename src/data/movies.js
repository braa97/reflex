      "Arthur is a young boy who just wants to be a knight's squire. Alas, he is dubbed 'Wart' early on, and it was all downhill from there for a while.

Watch to find out what the heck that means."

      "Basically the same as the original, except now Hermi-- Emma Wattson plays Belle, fittingly so some would say, given how actively progressive she is regarding women's rights. Rumor has it that in the bonus scenes she whips out a wand and turns Gaston into a toad, but in order to watch those scenes you need to recite a certain incantation."
